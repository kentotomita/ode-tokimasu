radau.m      Numerical solution of a stiff (or differential algebraic) system of
             first order ordinary differential equations:
             Mass*y' = OdeFcn(t,y).
             The system can be (linearly) implicit (mass-matrix Mass ~= I)
             or explicit (Mass = I)
             The code is based on implicit Runge-Kutta methods (Radau IIa)
             with variable order (1, 5, 9, 13), with step size control and
             continuous output.
